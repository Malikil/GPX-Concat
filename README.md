GPX Combiner
===

A single dialog box. You can pick two existing gpx files, it will add one to the other and save it. Then you can add another if desired.

Only supports tracks. Garmin extensions, waypoints, routes, and anything that's not trk, trkseg, and trkpt is ignored.  
It should be smart enough to notice when ele and time elements are missing but don't count on it.
